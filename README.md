# Machine-Learning-DPS---Destiny-2
This is intended to be a machine learning project to help calculate your DPS in real time by watching damage numbers on screen and calculating in real time.

shape_processing.py uses OpenCv contour detection to take video and detect shapes in real time within said video. That capture point (the variable 'cap') can be changed.
